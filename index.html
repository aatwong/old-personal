        <script> Greet(); </script>, you have reached the personal website of
        Andrew Atwong. If you would like to find out more about me, please visit
        my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewatwong" target="_blank">
          LinkedIn profile</a>, or if you're from Accenture, my
        <a href = "https://people.accenture.com/experience.aspx?accountname=andrew.atwong"

          People Page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website exists because I want to hear from you. If I have been a
        great friend or role model, or you feel I'm deserving of a compliment,
        please let me know&mdash;it will probably make my day! But I want to know
        how I can get better. I want to know where I have failed or fallen
        short in any aspect of my life that you are aware of, no matter how
        inconsequential or obvious it may seem.
        Since candid personal feedback seems so hard to come by, this
        is my attempt at breaking through the social or cultural boundaries
        that may prevent you from communicating with me freely.
        I truly believe that feedback&mdash;no matter how brutal, belated, or
        subjective&mdash;is the most elusive and valuable gift anyone can receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I would rather live in a world where anyone could give me
        feedback, at any time, so if you are comfortable doing that, please
        do, and do so often. But I've left a simple textbox for you to
        write an anonymous message anyway if you feel that isn't appropriate or
        convenient. I will have no way to respond to you, so all I can do
        is thank you, in advance, for helping me to become a better person.
      </p>
